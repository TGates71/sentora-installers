--- WARNING --- 

Even if I merged the "pull request #6 from zVPS/master" this evening (october 8th 0h), some bugs was localised in a few sections, mostly in postfix and dovecot but their correction is still not commited : some are still at work.

*** DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME TO TEST CURRENT VERSION UNITL I COMMITED THE CORRECTIONS : EMAILS WILL NOT WORK PROPERLY ***

I will remove this message as soon as it will be done, very probably tomorrow 9th close to midnight.




Unified installer in Alpha-test

Ubuntu 12 and 14 :
 - full install OK without error, services must be all tested
 
CentOs 6 and 7 :
- still many errors to solve.
